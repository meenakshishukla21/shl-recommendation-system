The SHL Assessment Recommendation Engine is a live web application deployed on Render, recommending SHL assessments based on user inputs like job role, industry, skills, and job level. Built with Python 3.x and Flask, it uses a weighted scoring system—job role (40%), industry (20%), skills (30%), and level (10%)—to rank assessments from a hardcoded SHL-like catalogue (e.g., Verify G+, OPQ32), replaceable with real data. Hosted on Render’s PaaS, it’s accessible via a public URL (e.g., your-app-name.onrender.com), leveraging Render’s auto-scaling and managed environment.

The frontend, developed with HTML5 and CSS3, features a responsive form and results display, powered by Jinja2 templating. Users submit inputs online, receiving tailored recommendations with descriptions. Deployment on Render uses Gunicorn as the WSGI server (e.g., via Procfile: web: gunicorn app:app) and a requirements.txt (e.g., flask, gunicorn), ensuring production-ready performance beyond Flask’s dev server. Future enhancements could integrate a PostgreSQL database (via Render’s managed DB) for catalogue storage or APIs for live SHL data, enhancing scalability.

Tech Stack: Python, Flask, HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2, Render, Gunicorn, PostgreSQL (optional).
